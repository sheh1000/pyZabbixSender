        #####Description:
        This is the constructor, to obtain an object of type pyZabbixSender, linked to work with a specific server/port.

        #####Parameters:
        * **server**: [in] [string] [optional] This is the server domain name or IP. *Default value: "127.0.0.1"*
        * **port**: [in] [integer] [optional] This is the port open in the server to receive zabbix traps. *Default value: 10051*
        * **verbose**: [in] [boolean] [optional] This is to allow the library to write some output to stderr when finds an error. *Default value: False*

        **Note: The "verbose" parameter will be revisited and could be removed/replaced in the future**

        #####Return:
        It returns a pyZabbixSender object.

        #####Description:
        Adds host, key, value and optionally clock to the internal list of data to be sent later, when calling one of the methods to actually send the data to the server.

        #####Parameters:
        * **host**: [in] [string] [mandatory] The host which the data is associated to.
        * **key**: [in] [string] [mandatory] The name of the trap associated to the host in the Zabbix server.
        * **value**: [in] [any] [mandatory] The value you want to send. Please note that you need to take care about the type, as it needs to match key definition in the Zabbix server. Numeric types can be specified as number (for example: 12) or text (for example: "12").
        * **clock**: [in] [integer] [optional] Here you can specify the Unix timestamp associated to your measurement. For example, you can process a log or a data file produced an hour ago, and you want to send the data with the timestamp when the data was produced, not when it was processed by you. If you don't specify this parameter, zabbix server will assign a timestamp when it receives the data.

            You can create a timestamp compatible with "clock" parameter using this code:
              int(round(time.time()))

            *Default value: None*

        #####Parameters:
        None

        #####Return:
        A copy of the internal data you added using the method *addData* (an array of dicts).

        This method delete one data point from the internal stored data. 

        It's main purpose is to narrow the internal data to keep only those failed data points (those that were not received/processed by the server) so you can identify/retry them. Data points can be obtained from *sendDataOneByOne* return, or from *getData* return.

        #####Parameters:
        * **data_point**: [in] [dict] [mandatory] This is a dictionary as returned by *sendDataOneByOne()* or *getData* methods.
